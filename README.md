# Pretty-Calendar---Glass

A simple javascript calendar with a glassmorphic UI

### Techs Used:

<ul>
  <li>HTML 5</li>
  <li>CSS 3</li>
  <li>Vanilla JavaScript</li>
</ul>

### Purpose:

The javascript file contains the logic of a calendar. It will fetch the system date from browser/device and then set that as today's date. The days and months are stored as arrays and  successive increments are carried out. An additional feature is, one can check what day a date falls on any month or year because the pointer remains on the same date as of the present day's date.
